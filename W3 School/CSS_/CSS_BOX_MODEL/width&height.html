    <h1>Hello Pink</h1>

    <div>Tower Research Capital is one of the oldest automated trading firms.[1] It was started by Mark Gorton and
        Alistair Brown in February 1998.</div>

    <div>Tower's internal trading teams are independent from one another, enjoying autonomy while accessing shared
        technology resources such as hardware, software, and connectivity as well as resources such as business
        management, legal, compliance, and risk management.</div>

    <div>At the heart of operations is the core engineering team, which owns the architecture, implementation and
        optimization of the trading platform itself. This includes developing systems and tools to access market data,
        perform trend analysis, run trading simulations, order entry and management, real-time trade support, risk
        management and post-trade services.</div>
